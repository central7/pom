= POM Jamal Support Files

This repository contains macro files that can be used to create `pom.xml.jam` files for Java Maven projects.
The Java `pom.xml` file is an XML formatted file that contains information about the Java project.
The XML description is verbose and sometimes redundant.
Using the Jamal preprocessor this format can be managed in a more readable and easier to maintain source.
